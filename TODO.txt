Define user stories to dictate which endpoints are needed
    the end points will then define the service methods needed
    this will also define any custom repository methods needed
    will need to look into custom methods that join tables and
    figure out where they need to live

add some customisation to /health
    (maybe use a cleaner endpoint /api/v1/recordstore/health that redirects)
